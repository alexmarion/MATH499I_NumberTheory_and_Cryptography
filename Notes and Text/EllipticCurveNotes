Elliptic Curve Cryptography

An elliptic curve over real numbers is defined by the set of points (x,y) which
satisfy an elliptic curve equation of the form y^2 = x^3 + ax + b where x,y,a,b
are real numbers.

If x^3 + ax + b contains now repeated factors, or equivalently if
4a^3 + 27b^2 != 0 then the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + ax + b can be used to form
a group. An elliptic curve group over real numbers consists of the points on the
corresponding elliptic curve together with a special point O called the point at
infinity.

The negative of a point P = (xP,yP) is its reflection on the x-axis
    -P = (xP,-yP)
For every P on an elliptic curve a -P exists

Suppose that P and Q are two distinct points on an elliptic curve and P != -Q
To add P and Q a line is drawn through the two points. This line will intersect
the elliptic curve in exactly one more point called -R. The point -R is
reflected on the x-axis to the point R. The law for addition in elliptic curve
curve group is P + Q = R

P and -P cannot be added as above because the line through them is vertical and
thus will never intersect a third point. The elliptic curve group includes the
point at infinity, O. By definition P + (-P) = O. As a result of this equation,
P + O = P. O is called the additive identity.

To add P to itself a tangent line is drawn. If yP != 0 then the tangent
intersects the curve at another point -R which is then reflected on the x-axis
to R. This is called doubling the point P and is defined by P + P = 2P = R

The tangent line from P is always vertical if yP = 0 and the tangent will never
intersect the curve. 2P = O for such a point P. In this case 2P + P = 3P = P
because P + O = P.

Arithmetic for adding two distinct points P and Q is shown below:
When P = (xP,yP) and Q = (xQ,yQ) and P != -Q
P + Q = R where
s = (yP-yQ)/(xP-xQ)
xR = s^2 - xP - xQ
yR = -yP + s(xP - xR)
R = (xR,yR)

Arithmetic for doubling the point P
When P = (xP,yP) and yP != 0
2P = R where
s = (3xP^2 + a)/(2yP)       // Recall that a is one of the curve parameters
                            // Recall that s is the tangent line to P
xR = s^2 - 2xP
yR = -yP + s(xP - xR)
R = (xR, yR)

------------------------------ Finite Fields -----------------------------------
Elliptic curve groups are calculated over finite fields of Fp and F2m. Fp uses
numbers from 0 to p-1 and computations end by taking the remainder on division
by p. For example, in F23 the field is composed of integers from 0 to 22 and any
operation within this field will result in an int also between 0 and 22.

................................... Fp .........................................
An elliptic curve with the underlying field of Fp can be formed by choosing
variables a and b within Fp. The elliptic curve includes all points (x,y) which
satisfy the elliptic curve equation mod p (where x and y are numbers in Fp).

For example: y^2 (mod p) = x^3 + ax + b (mod p) has an underlying field of Fp
if a and b are in Fp.

If x^3 + ax + b contains no repeating factors, equivalently if
4a^3 + 27b^2 (mod p) != 0 then the elliptic curve can be used to form a group.
An elliptic curve group over Fp consists of the points on the corresponding
elliptic curve, together with O. There are finitely many points on such an
elliptic curve.

The arithmetic rules for elliptic curve groups over Fp have to change as well
The negative of a point P = (xP, yP) is -P =(xP, -yP mod p).

Arithmetic for adding two distinct points P and Q is shown below:
When P = (xP,yP) and Q = (xQ,yQ) and P != -Q
P + Q = R where
s = (yP-yQ)/(xP-xQ) (mod p)
xR = s^2 - xP - xQ (mod p)
yR = -yP + s(xP - xR) (mod p)
R = (xR,yR)

Arithmetic for doubling the point P
When P = (xP,yP) and yP != 0
2P = R where
s = (3xP^2 + a)/(2yP) (mod p)   // Recall that a is one of the curve parameters
                                // Recall that s is the tangent line to P
xR = s^2 - 2xP (mod p)
yR = -yP + s(xP - xR) (mod p)
R = (xR, yR)
